## Tom

I'm Tom, a software developer with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. I am highly motivated to solve problems relevant to Unix/Linux servers, modular design, systems integrations, databases, client-server networking, data processing, and data visualization.
I love working with embedded microcontrollers, databases, and network protocols. My favorite programming languages are Python, C, C++, PHP, and Java.

Software I've created includes:
- [Veno Text Editor](https://tomawezome.github.io/veno): Multi-purpose fully-featured text/code editor meant for easy and vast expandability, written in Python.
- [CERBERUS 2080™ Program Suite](https://github.com/TomAwezome/cerberus2080-c-demos): Demo programs for The Byte Attic's CERBERUS 2080™ computer targeting its Z80 CPU written in C using Z88DK, featuring programs such as an 80x60 bitmap engine with integer DDA line draw, a tiny text editor, a RPN calculator, a scrolling tilemap renderer, and a RAM + heap memory diagnostic check.
- [Paper-io for Sega Genesis](https://github.com/TomAwezome/paper-io-genesis): Paper-io 1 Demake for Sega Genesis / Sega Mega Drive written in C using SGDK and gendev. 
- [DWM-time](https://github.com/TomAwezome/dwm-time): Simple Python program to update the DWM title bar with the current date and time.

Thanks for taking the time to read about my contributions on GitHub. I hope you have a great day.
